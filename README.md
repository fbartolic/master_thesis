# Master thesis - Planets orbiting evolving binary stars
A collection of code and Jupyter notebooks used to generate results and figures in my master's thesis on circumbinary planet dynamics and
mean motion resonances. In the thesis I study the divergent resonance passage of a high-order 6:1 mean motion resonance
through analytical modeling and numerical N-body simulations with the REBOUND code, coupled with binary_c stellar evolution code.
I could not include binary_c as it is not public. REBOUND is freely available at https://github.com/hannorein/rebound .
