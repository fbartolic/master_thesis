%************************************************
In this chapter, I introduce the main topic of the thesis, review the 
observational evidence of planets around binary stars, and review the 
basic theory of binary stellar evolution in order to motivate the problem.

\section{History}
\label{sec:History}
-write about exoplanets detection in recent
decades, mention first circumbinary planet around a pulsar
-plot by Fabrycky or similar of planets detected so far

\section{Binary stars and types of planetary orbits}
\label{sec:Binary_stars_and_types_of_planetary_orbits}
- define circumbinary planets, mention types of orbits
- mention planet formation around binaries
- define orbital elements and include figure

\section{Exoplanet detection techniques}
\label{sec:Exoplanet detection techniques}
- briefly describe detection techniques with a 
focus on transits nad TTVs

\section{Binary stellar evolution}
\label{sec:stellar_evolution}
- everything about stellar evolution goes into this chapter

Stellar evolution
is driven by compositional changes in the interiors of stars due to nuclear 
reactions which in turn affect the physical properties of the star 
via the stellar structure equations. If the two stars in a binary are 
sufficiently far away they will evolve independently. In circumbinary systems
however the stars tend to be very close together, and the stars will generally
interact. For questions regarding the stability of circumbinary planets
, we are most interested in the variation of the parameters of the stellar 
orbit, namely the semi-major axis $a_i$ and
the eccentricity $e_i$. 

\subsection{Evolution on the main sequence}
\label{sub:Evolution on the main sequence}
- describe Roche Lobe surfaces and the Lagrange points

\subsection{Post main sequence evolution and the common envelope}
\label{sub:Post main sequence evolution and the common envelope}
- branches of stellar evolution, roche lobe overflow, mass loss
and mass transfer
- don't mention sweeping resonances, just mention that as the binary
evolves bad things can happen to the planets

\section{Two populations of circumbinary planets}
\label{sec:Two populations of circumbinary planets}
- describe the MS and post-MS observations of CBPs
- tables and plots of basic properties
- mention Zorotovich and Schreiber paper
- mention theories about the origin of the PCE planets
