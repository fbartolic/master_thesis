\chapter{An analytical model of high-order mean--motion resonances}
\label{ch:analytical_model_of_high_order_mmrs}
%************************************************
The second chapter deals with analytic models of mean--motion resonances
(MMRs for short). This concept is the key part of the thesis because the overlap
of MMRs and the passage of planetary or stellar bodies through them 
are crucial for the determination of the stability of planetary bodies. 
Here I develop a new analytical model of a 6:1 resonance in the case 
where the inner two bodies are 
comparable in mass. The 6:1 MMR is the first important resonance encountered
by circumbinary planets similar to the observed MS population once the 
binary starts evolving off the main--sequence. I use this 
model to predict the eccentricity kick to a planet orbiting the evolving
binary as the stars approach each other due to tidal forces.
