%************************************************
In this chapter, I introduce the main topic of the thesis, review the 
observational evidence of planets around binary stars, and review the 
basic theory of binary stellar evolution in order to motivate the problem.

\section{History}
\label{sec:History}
-write about exoplanets detection in recent
decades, mention first circumbinary planet around a pulsar
-plot by Fabrycky or similar of planets detected so far

\section{Binary stars and types of planetary orbits}
\label{sec:Binary_stars_and_types_of_planetary_orbits}
- define circumbinary planets, mention types of orbits
- mention planet formation around binaries
- define orbital elements and include figure

\section{Exoplanet detection techniques}
\label{sec:Exoplanet detection techniques}
- briefly describe detection techniques with a 
focus on transits nad TTVs

\section{Binary stellar evolution}
\label{sec:Binary stellar evolution}
- everything about stellar evolution goes into this chapter

\subsection{Evolution on the main sequence}
\label{sub:Evolution on the main sequence}
- describe Roche Lobe surfaces and the Lagrange points

\subsection{Post main sequence evolution and the common envelope}
\label{sub:Post main sequence evolution and the common envelope}
- branches of stellar evolution, roche lobe overflow, mass loss
and mass transfer
- don't mention sweeping resonances, just mention that as the binary
evolves bad things can happen to the planets

\section{Two populations of circumbinary planets}
\label{sec:Two populations of circumbinary planets}
- describe the MS and post-MS observations of CBPs
- tables and plots of basic properties
- mention Zorotovich and Schreiber paper
- mention theories about the origin of the PCE planets
